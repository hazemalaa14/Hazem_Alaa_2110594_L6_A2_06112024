Very simple app , user would get to choose between rolling either 1,2,3 Dice, each with their respective logic and designs, by using the roll button on any dice option, user would get a result and he could always roll again.

•	1 die interface is pretty simple, it displays an image for a die and each time Roll Dice is pressed it displays a random image.


2 Dice UI/UX: I designed it in a form of a minigame of luck, where the you get to choose a side either red or blue and you have a 50/50 to win if the dice value of the side you choose is higher you win.
•	If you choose blue side & you won, a blue colored message is displayed You win & if you lost, You lost is displayed and vice versa or red side
•	Roll Dice button is null until user chooses either side as in the ScreenShot in the first page


3 Dice UI/UX: It is designed as a mini casino game where you get to cash in if the three dice are equal
•	I used toSet() to identify if the three values are unique or not.
•	If the user got lucky and he gets to cash in, A message Jackpot!!!!! In gold color appears.
•	If he is unlucky, a message  “99% of gamblers quit before hitting it big” appears.
•	For testing purposes, I made it so the 3rd iteration always hits the jackpot(6,6,6)
